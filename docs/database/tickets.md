## Tables Overview

The Ticketing System utilizes the following core tables:

1. `tickets` - Main ticket records
2. `ticket_comments` - Comments and conversation threads for tickets
3. `ticket_statuses` - Available ticket status options
4. `ticket_priorities` - Priority level definitions
5. `ticket_types` - Types of tickets (task, bug, feature, etc.)
6. `ticket_attachments` - Files attached to tickets
7. `visitors` - Visitor registration and tracking
8. `visitor_statuses` - Status options for visitors
